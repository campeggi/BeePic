Geolocate photos by time</big> (ver. 0.1 - experimental)<b><br>
<br>
<br>
Aim</b><b>:</b>
geo-locate photos according to shooting time<b><br>
<br>
Requirements</b><b>:</b><br>
- EXIF data with shooting
time in the image files<br>
- a layer of reference
points with date-time attributes (GPS track-points)<b><br>
<br>
Output:</b>
a layer of points showing the position each photo was taken<b><br>
<br>
Description:</b><br>
This plugin locate digital
photos according to shooting time thanks to the comparison with a
layer of reference points (usually the points of a GPS track). Image
files must have EXIF data with the shooting time ('DateTimeOriginal'
tag) and the reference layer must have a field with date and time of
acquisition in table of attributes.<br>
<span lang="en-GB">The plugin reads the shooting time of each photo
and looks for the reference point with the same time or the two
points whose date-time contain it; in this last case the plugin
calculates a proportion between times and positions to locate the
photo on the right distance in the segment between the two
points.<br>Often the clock of the digital camera isn't synchronized
with GPS time; to correct the </span>consequent <span lang="en-GB">error
you need to insert the delay of the photos over the reference points.
If this value is unknown you can select a photo taken in a known
place, show its position on the map and change the delay value until
the right position is reached.</span></p>
